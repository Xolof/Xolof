- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Xolof
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making fast and user friendly applications.
- ðŸŒ± My current learning focus is on React. Along the way I also try to learn more about Linux, Nginx, Docker, MySQL, PHP, Laravel, NodeJS, Sass and many more tools. When I know React a little bit better I will explore Svelte. Then I plan to make some projects with Next.js and maybe some other static site generators. Maybe I will try setting up some headless Wordpress and possibly Woocommerce with Next.js.
